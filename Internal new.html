<p style="color:powderblue">A sport utility vehicle is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground
clearance and four-wheel drive. There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV and usage of the term varies between countries.</p>

<p style="color:purple">A hatchback is a car body configuration with a rear door that swings upward to provide access to the main interior of the car as a cargo area rather than just to a
separated trunk. Hatchbacks may feature fold-down second-row seating, where the interior can be reconfigured to prioritize passenger or cargo volume.</p>

<p style="color:brown">A sedan or saloon is a passenger car in a three-box configuration with separate compartments for an engine, passengers, and cargo. The first recorded use of sedan
in reference to an automobile body occurred in 1912.The different construction of a sedan increases its price in comparison to hatchbacks but also allows for more
interior passenger space and leg room.</p>
