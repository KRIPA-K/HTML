<h1>CARS</h1>
<hr>
<p1>
A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily
on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.The development
of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately
from the development of true cars.A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part
of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers.In the United Kingdom,
sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865

<h2>HATCHBACK</h1>
<hr>
<p2>
Hatchbacks are one of the most popular car body types in terms of overall sales in India. A hatchback can be defined
as a vehicle body type that comprises four doors along with an additional rear hatch that opens upward to access the
boot space. Hatchbacks are generally designed with compact bodies and are perfect for comfortably seating up to
five passengers. Nonetheless, the most striking feature of this segment is the boot: a space behind the rear seats</br>.
