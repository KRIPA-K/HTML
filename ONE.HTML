<BR><U>Short Solution</U>: This paper proposes a smart learning automated system for home automation that addresses the limitations of traditional systems.</BR><BR>By combining machine learning algorithms and computer vision, the system analyzes user actions and surroundings to predict future actions and minimize user interaction.</BR><BR> It controls lighting, temperature, multimedia systems, and appliances based on the user's emotion.</BR><BR> The system connects multiple devices to a centralized server and provides a user interface through a tablet or mobile application for local and remote control.</BR><BR> This intelligent approach enhances the responsiveness and adaptability of the home automation system, making it more intuitive and efficient.</BR>
