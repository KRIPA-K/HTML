        Derived from the Latin term “sedere” which means “to sit”, sedans are designed to provide utmost comfort and
        convenience for passengers both at the front as well as the rear. The major component of a sedan is its longer
        body that’s built with a three-box configuration consisting of pillars identified as A, B, and C pillars.

        Quite popular in the Indian market, SUV is a car body-type that comprises vehicles that are both passenger
        vehicles as well as off-roaders. SUVs are generally large and measure well over the 4 meter mark, with compact
